# Reimplementing Reinforcement Learning from Preferences on Atari

Testing the generalization properties of [T-REX](https://github.com/hiwonjoon/ICML2019-TREX/blob/master/atari/LearnAtariReward.py) algorithm on [Procgen](https://github.com/openai/procgen) suite of environments

This is an work-in-progress implemetation of [Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences paper from Christiano et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741)
